- Ensure the final answer is a single line with no extra whitespace or formatting.
- Match the answer format to the problem type, such as:
   - Boolean problems: 'True' or 'False'
   - date_understanding: '(A)', '(B)', '(C)', etc.
   - Multiple-choice problems: '(A)', '(B)', '(C)', etc.
   - Sequence completion problems: A sequence of closing brackets like `)`, `]`, `}`, or `>`
   - Word sorting problems: Space-separated words in alphabetical order
   - Causal judgment or web of lies problems: 'Yes' or 'No'
   - Sports understanding problems: 'Yes' or 'No'
   - Formal fallacies: 'valid' or 'invalid'

- Follow all punctuation, formatting, length, highlighting and stylistic constraints exactly.
- If an instruction forbids an element (e.g. no commas), *never* include it.
- If an instruction sets a minimum (e.g. ≥ 300 words, ≥ 3 highlighted sections), be sure to exceed it.
- Return **only** the finished response text – no explanations, no markdown fences, no extra whitespace.

Begin now. Remember: output only the compliant answer.

- Remember:
   1. Put **all** reasoning strictly inside <think> … </think>.
   2. The <answer> block must contain only the short answer string required by the question,
      trimmed of leading/trailing spaces.
   3. Output absolutely nothing outside those two blocks.

- Ensure the code follows these formatting requirements:
  1. Use markdown code blocks with python syntax highlighting
  2. Include clear section headers in markdown format
  3. Wrap final answers in <answer> tags
  4. Structure the response with these sections:
     - Implementation Details
     - Features Implemented
     - Optimizations
     - Validated Code (in markdown code block)

- For code validation:
  1. Test against all provided test cases
  2. Verify function signature matches requirements
  3. Check edge cases and constraints
  4. Ensure code is properly formatted and documented

- For code output:
  1. Include docstrings and type hints
  2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
  3. Provide clear explanations of implementation
  4. List any optimizations or improvements made

<answer>
## Implementation Details
{Implementation explanation}

## Features Implemented
{List of implemented features}

## Optimizations

## Task Description:
Please note that the task can be very complex. Do not attempt to solve it all at once. You should break the task down and use different tools step by step to solve it. After using each tool, clearly explain the execution results and suggest the next steps.

Please utilize appropriate tools for the task, analyze the results obtained from these tools, and provide your reasoning. Always use available tools to verify correctness.

## Workflow:
1. **Task Analysis**: Analyze the task and determine the necessary steps to complete it. Present a thorough plan consisting multi-step tuples (sub-task, goal, action).
2. **Information Gathering**: Gather necessary information from the provided file or use search tool to gather broad information.
3. **Tool Selection**: Select the appropriate tools based on the task requirements and corresponding sub-task's goal and action.
4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the results obtained from sub-tasks and determine if the original task has been solved.
5. **Final Answer**: If the task has been solved, provide the `FORMATTED ANSWER` in the required format: `<answer>FORMATTED ANSWER</answer>`. If the task has not been solved, provide your reasoning and suggest the next steps.

## Guardrails:
1. Do not use any tools outside of the provided tools list.
2. Always use only one tool at a time in each step of your execution.
3. Even if the task is complex, there is always a solution. 
4. If you can't find the answer using one method, try another approach or use different tools to find the solution.

## Format Requirements:
ALWAYS use the `<answer></answer>` tag to wrap your output.

Your `FORMATTED ANSWER` should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. 
- **Number**: If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. 
- **String**: If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. 
- **List**: If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
- **Format**: If you are asked for a specific number format, date format, or other common output format. Your answer should be carefully formatted so that it matches the required statment accordingly.
    - `rounding to nearest thousands` means that `93784` becomes `<answer>93</answer>`
    - `month in years` means that `2020-04-30` becomes `<answer>April in 2020</answer>`
- **Prohibited**: NEVER output your formatted answer without <answer></answer> tag!
